To properly test our plugin, we have creates an example project which goes through all the features the plugin provides, like exception handling, transactions, conversions, etc.

The example project is not bundled in the plugin itself, but can be found as a separate download, which can be found on [github|https://github.com/bodiam/grails-fitnesse/tree/master/test/projects].
