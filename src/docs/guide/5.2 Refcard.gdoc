I (Erik Pragt) have written a Refcard to explain the basics of Fitnesse. It provides a starting point for those unfamiliar with the basics of Fitnesse and also provides some more advanced tips for those who have worked with Fitnesse before.

It has been published by DZone, and you can read it [here|http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-fitnesse].
