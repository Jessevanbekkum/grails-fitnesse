The Wiki contains all the tests. The wiki consists of two parts:

* Formatted text
* Tables

Tables are the tests, and only tables are executed.

The following tests are at least supported by the Grails Fitnesse plugin:

{table}
 *Name* | *Description*
Decision Table |Supplies the inputs and outputs for decisions.  This is similar to the Fit Column Fixture
Query Table|Supplies the expected results of a query.  This is similar to the Fit Row Fixture
Script Table| A series of actions and checks. Similar to Do Fixture.
Import |Add a path to the fixture search path.
{table}

The following tables might work, but at the moment, they haven't been tested yet. They are included here for completeness.

{table}
 *Name* | *Description*
Table Table| Whatever you want it to be!
Subset Query Table |Supplies a subset of the expected results of a query.
Ordered query Table|Supplies the expected results of a query.  The rows are expected to be in order.  This is similar to the Fit Row Fixture
Comment |A table that does nothing.
Scenario Table|A table that can be called from other tables.
Library Table|A table that installs fixtures available for all test pages
{table}
