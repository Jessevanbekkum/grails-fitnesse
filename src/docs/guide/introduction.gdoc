The Fitnesse plugin provides a integration point between the popular Open Source testing framework [Fitnesse:http://www.fitnesse.org] and Grails applications.

This guide documents the usage of the plugin and provides an easy starting point to get you up to speed with the plugin as well as with Fitnesse.

{note}
Note that the *SLIM* version of Fitnesse is supported. FIT, the older Fitnesse protocol, is not yet supported, nor will it be supported in the near future.

*** Complete refactoring of the plugin thanks to Marcin Erdmann (ie using Artefacts, Artefact Templates, JSON Code to enable complex objects, and more!)
*** *Important*: All fixtures should now be end with the suffix 'Fixture', as in 'CalculateFixture'. In the Wiki you can still refer to them as 'Calculate', but the plugin adds a Fixture suffix when looking for the class.
