!1 Functionality - Buy a Book Combo

The core of our business is to sell books. To sell as much books as possible, we've introduced the concept of package deals (or promo packages, or book combos, or just-really-good-deals, as our customers call it). Since this is such an important part of our business, we need to assert it works correctly. 

There are is currently on type of discount: a fixed price (say 10 euro's discount on the total amount, which we'll call AMOUNT), but it would be nice if, in the future, we could also get a discount which is percentage based.

At the moment, we can link together books based on their ISBN code. We know it's not ideal, so in the future we should introduce our own code, but currently it works good enough, so any package can ben created by linking two books together. A promo package of more than two books is not needed at the moment, but would be nice for the future, say the end of 2013.

!2 Exercise

Step 1. Create a script and fixture for the execute step, that places an order with two books from a promotion package and checks if the charged Subtotal, Discount and Total are correct.
