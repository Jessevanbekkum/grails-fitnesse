#!3 Using the SLIM Test System
#If you want a test page to be run under SLIM, you simply set the TEST_SYSTEM variable to "slim" instead of "fit". {{{&bang;define TEST_SYSTEM {slim} }}} If this variable is set on your page, (as it is on this page!) or on any parent page, then your page will be run with Slim.
#
#Also, when using the Grails integration, you'll need to define a dummy command pattern: {{{&bang;define COMMAND_PATTERN {echo} }}} This makes sure Fitnesse doesn't execute anything, since the Grails Fitnesse server should already be running.
#
#!3 The Slim Tables
#The first cell of a slim table tells you what kind of table it is. Here are the table types so far:

|[[Decision Tables][>DecisionTables]]|Supplies the inputs and outputs for decisions.  This is similar to the Fit Column Fixture|
|[[Query Tables][>QueryTables]]|Supplies the expected results of a query.  This is similar to the Fit Row Fixture|
|[[Script Tables][>ScriptTables]]|A series of actions and checks.  Similar to Do Fixture.|
|[[Import][>ImportTables]]|Add a path to the fixture search path.|
