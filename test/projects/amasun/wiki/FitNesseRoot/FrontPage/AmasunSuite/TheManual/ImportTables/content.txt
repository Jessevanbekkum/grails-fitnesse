!3 Import tables

It's possible to load Fixtures with their fully qualified name:

!|nl.jworks.guide.Deduct          |
|operand 1|operand 2|result?|
|1        |3        |-2     |

However, when using the import table, you can tell the Slim Executor where the fixtures live.

|import   |
|nl.jworks|

This way, only the classname of the fixture is needed.

|deduct                     |
|operand 1|operand 2|result?|
|1        |3        |-2     |
|1        |11       |-10    |
|100      |80       |20     |
|35       |1        |34     |
|10       |6        |4      |
|999      |999      |0      |
|500      |106      |394    |
