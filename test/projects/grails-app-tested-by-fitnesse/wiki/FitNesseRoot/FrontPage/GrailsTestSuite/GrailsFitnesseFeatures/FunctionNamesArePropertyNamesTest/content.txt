Normally, decision tables are using a setter and a 'function', which is not a setter, but the same method name as the word in front of the question mark (see below).
Since this doesn't apply to the setters, but only to getters, I find this behavior weird, and changed it by delegating 'name?' also to 'getName()'.

|function name is property name|
|name|name?|
|erik|erik|

'''Code'''
{{{
class FunctionNameIsPropertyNameFixture {
    String name
}
}}}

This also holds true for booleans:

|boolean function name is property name|
|happy|happy?|
|true|true|

'''Code'''
{{{
class BooleanFunctionNameIsPropertyNameFixture {
    boolean happy
}
}}}
