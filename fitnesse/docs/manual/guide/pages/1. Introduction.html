<li>March 22, 2011</li>
<ul class="star">

<ul class="star">
<li>We upped the version number to 0.9 because the plugin is quite feature complete now, and is almost stable enough to be a 1.0.</li>

<ul class="star">
<li>0.4 Release, thanks to Marcin Erdmann!</li>
<ul class="star">
<li>Complete refactoring of the plugin thanks to Marcin Erdmann (ie using Artefacts, Artefact Templates, JSON Code to enable complex objects, and more!)</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Important</strong>: All fixtures should now be end with the suffix 'Fixture', as in 'CalculateFixture'. In the Wiki you can still refer to them as 'Calculate', but the plugin adds a Fixture suffix when looking for the class.</li>
<li>Improved error messages</li>
<li>You can now create complex objects from within Fitnesse by using JSON syntax.</li>
<li>More documentation!</li>
